# The Uzbek Wordnet (UzWordnet)

UzWordnet is a lexical-semantic database, or a “word-net”, for the (Northern) Uzbek language (native: _O’zbek_ till) compatible with [Princeton Wordnet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu). By providing it open source (see License), we aim to motivate, support, and increase the application of database and knowledge graphs principles and techniques to the study of computational aspects of the (Northern) Uzbek language and, more generally, the usability of Uzbek within IT applications and the Internet.

The (Northern) Uzbek language is (the) statutory national language in Uzbekistan. It is a Turkic language spoken by approximately 26.8 million people around the world, remarkably by a large group of ethnic Uzbeks residing abroad, cf. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbek_language).
