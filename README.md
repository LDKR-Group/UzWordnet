# The Uzbek Wordnet (UzWordnet)

UzWordnet is a lexical-semantic database, or a “word-net”, for the (Northern) Uzbek language (native: *O’zbek* till) compatible with [Princeton Wordnet] (https://wordnet.princeton.edu). By providing it open source (see License), we aim to motivate, support, and increase the application of database and knowledge graphs principles and techniques to the study of computational aspects of the (Northern) Uzbek language and, more generally, the usability of Uzbek within IT applications and the Internet.

The (Northern) Uzbek language is (the) statutory national language in Uzbekistan. It is a Turkic language spoken by approximately 26.8 million people around the world, remarkably by a large group of ethnic Uzbeks residing abroad, cf. [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbek_language).

### Formatting PWN source files for further use

For the future UWN algorithm, the database file from PWN <em>data.noun</em> was more convenient to use with Python in tabular form. For this reason, Python along with Pandas library was used to obtained a conveniently formatted .csv file for further processing. The script called pwn_formatting is performing this task: it takes <em>data.noun</em> file as input and outputs two tabular files - <em>pwn.csv</em> and <em>pwn_unindexed.csv</em>

### Querying Google Translate API
For communicating with the API, api_translation.py script was written. The script takes <em>pwn_unindexed.csv</em> file (which is the output from pwn_formatting.py) and produces list of files as output:

* <em>dump_responses.txt</em> - used for backup of the responses from the API
* <em>uwn_repetitive.csv</em> - a modified tabular file <em>pwn_unindexed.csv</em> that was filled with translations from the API. May contain repetitions
* <em>uwn_xlsx_repetitive.xlsx</em> - same file as <em>uwn_repetitive.csv</em>, but in .xslx format
* <em>uwn.csv</em> - same as <em>uwn_repetitive.csv</em>, but with no repetitions in individual cells of translations column
* <em>uwn_xlsx.csv</em> - same file as <em>uwn.csv</em>, but in .xslx format
